transcribed‚ with an addition aud aa abbreviation or
two, down to the account of the four battles of
Vortimer with the Saxona. The Brut is then again
partially coincident with the Eulogium. From the
commenoement of the chapter which is headed “In-
“ cipit Vita Merlini, cum Prophetiis” (cap. xta), down
to the end ol the History of king Arthur‚ it is clear,
as hasbeen already mentioued, that the Historia of
Geoffrey has been the sole authority drawn upon for
materiale, the only addition of any importunae being
a short account of the discovery of the sepulchre of Ι
that prince at Glastonbury, in the reign of king
Richard the Fir-st, which is appended to the life.
· Geoffrcy is still followed, though ¹not very closely,
down to the death of Cadwall0‚ when we find a
orici account oi Havelok the Daue, interpolated
between that event and the accessiones Gadwallader‚
after which the Historia is the sole source to the
eud. No correction ol the well-known mistalre made
by Geoffrey in his partial identification of the British
king Cadwallader with Caedwslla ol Wessex¹ is

attempted by our author, who indeed adds to the
blunder by actually confounding lui, the son of
Oadwallader‚ with Ina of Wessex, the son of Caedwalla,
at the very corumenoement of his brief chronicle ol'
the saxon hingo.
