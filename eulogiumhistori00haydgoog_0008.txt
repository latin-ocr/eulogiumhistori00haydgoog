The works to be published in octavo, separately, as
they were finished3 the whole responsibility of the task
testing upon the editors, who were to be chosen by the
M aster of the Rolls with the sanction of the Treasury.

The Lords of Her Majesty’s Treosury, after a careful
wconsideration of the subject, expressed their opinion iu a
Treasury Minuta, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
recommended by the Master of the Rolls “was well
calculated for the accomplishment of this important
nationnl object, in an effectuul and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention bc
paid to economy, in making the detailcd arrangements,
without unnecessary expense.”

They expressed their approbationes the proposal that
each chroniele and historical document should be edited
in such a manner as to represent with all possible correct·
ness the text of each writer, derived from scollation of the
best MSS, and that uo notes should be added, except
such as were illustrative of the various readings. They
suggested, however, that the prefacc to each work should
contain, in addition to the particulare proposed by the
’ Master of the Rolls, a biographical account of the author,
so far as authentic materials existed for that purpose, and

an estimate of his historical credibility and value.
