PourAcE. XXV

a Gecgrcphicnl Dictioncry, compiled from various

sources; ond it is very probuble, on grounds which will

· ' -be developed as we proceed‚ thot u lorge portion of the

Fourth Book of the Eulogium has been copied from it or
some similar work. Referenoe to it will render iutel-
ligible many passages in our text, which the omissions
committed by our author in transcribing from it, or from
some work closely· resembling it, forthere ure visible
here und there indicatione of an independent source, have
rendered unoonstruable. It has been us bcdly abbre-
viatedcs the Polichronicon for the First Book, ond tho
some species of errors huve been committed in both cases.
The next chapter of the Eulogium is almost entirely
taken from this Dictionsry; for though the quote·
tion from Isidorus, with which it commences has cer-
tainly boen transcribed from the Etymologiae‚ ond not
from K, yet os the different authorities subsequently
quoted ure the same, and follow one another in ex-
uctly the sums order in both K. aud the Eulogium,
sud us moreover the incremento of the text of Κ. on
thot of the Eulogium supply omissione iu the latter
which spoil tho sense, it is mors thun probable that
the text of K. represents the source from which cur
author obtained the lnrger portion of his materiale for
cup. xr. Higden quotes only u portion of the authorities
