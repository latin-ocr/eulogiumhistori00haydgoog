is mentioned and the Legend of the Purgation of
Quaen Emma¹ introduced, which forms the subject
of cap. cnxxxlv. The source of this legend is cer-
tainly not the Polichronicon‚ the account there given
(lib. v1. cap. 23) being less circumstantia] than that
in the Eulogium, and differing in some particulare
common to both. 'lhe accounts in Brompton and
Knighton are verbally the same as Higden's. Our
author's version of this legend more nearly resembles
thot given by Polydore Vergil, as quoted in the Acta
Sanctorum. The legend is undoubtedly of modern
origin, as it does not appear in any of the earlier
lives of the Confessor. The date which isgiven at
the end of p. 186, professedly from the Historiae
Britonum, differs in excess from that assigned to the
event by Higden by three years.

F ollowing this we have an account of S. Arcuulfus,
here called Amulius, which may possibly have been
taken from the Polichronicon‚ where it is given under
AD. 698, and is quoted from the Historia Ecclesias-
tica of Beda (lib. v. cap. 15, ed. Stevenson, p. 372).
