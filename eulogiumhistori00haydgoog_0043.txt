commencement of that of AEthiopia from the same ,
source, and not, Ι think, from the quotation in the

Geographia, for the slight verbal deviatione of the
letter from Isidorus are not repeated in the Eulo-
gium. The Geographia, however, most probably lay
open before our authores he wrote, for he takes it
up as soon as Isidorus leaves off, and continues to
use it to the end of the chapter.¹ In cap. LIV, not-
withstanding the account of Byzacena already given
from Isidorus in cap. XLVIII, we have another from
the Geographia under the alius Braceana, followed by
a brief notice of Dothan or Dodan from the same
work, the reference there given to the Gloss on
Ezekiel xvll. being omitted. In cap. ΙΝ. the whole
account of Gades is wrongly referred to Isidorus, whose
description ends with the word “ceromina,” the re·
mainder being from the Geographia ; the part here
properly belonging to the Etymologiee sometimes co·
incides with the text of Isidorus, but more often with.
the paraphrase of it in the Geographia. The account
of Carthago in cap. LVI, isa confused version of the
confused account in the often employed Geographia
Universalis. The first words, “Carthago est in Hispania
