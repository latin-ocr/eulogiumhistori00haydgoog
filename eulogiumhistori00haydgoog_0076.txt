lxviii raasson

the duhcdom of Normandy on the death of his father,
all probably condensed hom the chronicle of William
of Jumiegea

The lurger portion ol cap. ccxxxwa is occupied by
enarrative, at first very brief, alterwards more de·
tailed, of the events of English history, from the
marriage ol Aethelred II. and Emma to the death of
William the Conqueror. There are many peculiarities
in the representatione ol facts existing in the earlier
part of this narrative, which, combined with occasional
verbal coincidences‚ would seem ιο show that our
author either here actually copied the Historia Anglo-

authorities as that chronieler, with the addition of
matter from other sources, or at least employed some
later authority in which the facts peculiar to Hunt-
iugdon and the additional matter had been already
combined in the form in which they appear in the
Eulogium. With Huntiugdon he represents Aelfred,
the son of Aethelred and Emma, as having been sent

cister the death of Harthaenut, the Angla-Sanos
chronicle and Floreuce of Worcester assigning his
arrival and martyrdom to ab. 1036, during the life
ol Harold Harefoot. With Huntingdon again our author·
asserta that Edward, the brother of Aelfred, ou his
brocher's death, was summoned fram Normandy3

whereas, according to the Saxou chronicle, he had
arrived in England iu Ab. 1041, before the death of
his predecessor.

Alter the account of tha marriage of Edward our
author appears to have gone ιο a new authority, lor
the account of the events subsequent to that union is
much more fully given than in the chroniele ol
Huntingdon, and approaches sometimes very closely to
the account in the Gesta of William of Malmesbury,
more olten to that given in the Historia Major of
