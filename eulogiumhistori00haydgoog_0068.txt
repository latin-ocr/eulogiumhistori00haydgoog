the kingdoma of the Heptarchy. The mention of the
victories of Aethelstan attha end of thie account sug-
gests a digression concerning the pilgrimage made by
that monarch to the shrine of S. John of Beverley‚
the miraculous proni of the subjection of the Seots to
the English nt the cnstle of Dunhar, an accourd of
tho battle of Brunanburg, and the miraculous inser-
tion oia sword into the royal scahbard on that occa·
sion, which are all noticed in the same order by
Higden in another part of his chronicle. That thia

passage hasbeen copied from the Sixth Book of the
Polichronicon is rendered very proboble‚ in spite of a

few additions, by tho fact that a date, nl). 940, hos
been affixed to the concluding portion of the extract
which actually belongs to an event immediately suc-
ceeding in that work but omitted by our author, and

· which is, moreover, at the same time inapplicable to

the incident to which it is applied in the Eulogium.¹
