date. Thus much, however, is clear from the preceding
part of the Proem, that what is now the Fiftlr Book
was, or was intended to be, the last division of the
work when the Proem was written, and therefore that
the work must have terminated with some entry in
that division, in spite of the conclusion induced by a
anione praesag& in the autograph, imperfectly cor-
rected, that a portion at least of the Fiitlr Book was
written before that division of the work which is now
called tho Third Book.

The liccadiar manner in which the words “ Edwardo”
and “ 'l'ertio'' arc written ia tlre autograph will alfard
us no assistance towards determining the original ex·
tent of the work3 the only inference which we arc
compelled ιο draw from the addition of these two
words subsequently to the remainder of the Proem
being that already stated in the Preface ιο the Tirst
Volume, that the Proem must have been written

before the work was finislred, unless we would suppose ,

the author to have been ignorant of the name of the
king of England under whom he wrote it

Thus there appears tc bo no evidence contained in
the Proem to show with what entry the siah Book
originally terminated. On grounds of general proba-
bility, indeed, it is more likely than not that the
author would bring his Annale down to bis own times,
and even to the very date at which he wne writing3
and this general likelihood will be confirmed in the
sequel, where it will be shown that the entry for
ΑΒ. 1362 was most probably written in that year
itself, and that therefore that entry was most probably
the original termination of the Eulogium.

With regard to that portion of the work which

extends beyond AD.1362, it will appear that the
