A recapitulation of the various provinces iu Asia
and Africa occupies caps. Lm and LXI. It is professedly
taken from Rabanus Matutae, and is to be found in
his treatise De Universo, the text of which coincides
almost verbally with that of Isidorus, and is here
followed with great olosoness.¹ We theu come, appa-
rently, from the rubrio “Jam de Europa,’⁷ to tho
author's great satisfaction, to tho account of Europe
in Isidorus? followed, in cap.1.x111.,by an account of
Scythia (Inferior) from the Geographia, which applies
part 51 the description of the Asiatic Scythia in Isi-
dorus, already given in oap. xxvm, to that 51 the
European Scythia here given. This is concluded by a
short notice 51 Alania from some unknown source. Tho
