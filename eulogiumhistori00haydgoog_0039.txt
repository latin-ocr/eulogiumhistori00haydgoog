(Superior) is given in the exact words of Isidorus¹
The account of Bactria is taken again from the
Geographia‚ as the coincidence of its deviatione
from that in the Etymologiae with those in the
former distinotly shows. The curicus reading men-
tioned in the note' appears to be an actual con-
jectural emendation of the remarkable corruption of
Isidorus which existe in the Geographia, as well as
in many MSS. of the Etymologiae. The first nina
words of the account of Hyrcania, in cap. xxx,
are from the Etymologiae, the rest is copied from
the ΜΒ. K, which is compiled partly from the Ety-
mologiae‚ Books xlv, 1111, the Historiae of Orosius,
Book 11, and the Master of the Histories The latter
authority is mentioned at the end of the chapter,
hut the reference in Κ. “in principio Historiae Evan-
“ gehcee” is absurdly shortened to “in principio.’'

The accounts of Iberia and Albania, chaps. xxxl. and
