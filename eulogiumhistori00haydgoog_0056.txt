xlviii enerues.

Eulogium, aethe (ieographia Universalis appears to have
been copied for the preceding portion of the Foarth Book.
The two latter chapters, cap. ccx. and ccxl, coincide
much more closely with the account of Hibernia in
the Poliohronieon, as represented hythe text of MS.
Harl. No. 655, though here also there are slight addi·
tions, giving greater detail and circumstantiality in a
few particulam, to the descriptione of Higden, 'lhc
arrangement of the chapters in the Poliohronieon is
somewhat disturbed however, for aster commencing
with the account of the first inhabitants in cap. cam,
and following Higden's order in cap. ccx, and the
first half of cap. cm, our author, mentioning him as
“the monle of Chester,'' goes back to his discussion
on S. Patrick's staff and the snakes in a preceding
chapter of the Poliohronieon He then extracts nearly
the whole of the chapter again preceding that, quotes
the remarks of Higden, again refening to him, upon
the account of chester by William of Malmesbury in
another part of the earne book, and finally extr'acts a
portion of a chapter upon Ireland, which precedes all
tho others which he has hitherto quoted. lt may
perhaps be supposed that the contradictione of the
“monh of chester? which are to be found in this
part of the Eulogium, would hardly have been made if
our author had been copying him so freely aud so
recently aa has been asserted, and it certainly does
seem to need some explanation. But I see no escape
from the conclusion that it is Higden and no other
person who has been used and vilified. If the ac·
count of Hibernia in the Poliohronieon had been taken
from one source only, the supposition that both
authors had used that source independently might
have been teneble; but, itis not only Giraldus, but
Solinus and Beda, who contributa to Higden’e account,
and the order iu which the extracta are arranged is,
the same in that work and in the Eulogium. Resides
