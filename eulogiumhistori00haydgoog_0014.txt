Achiuom but nearly contemporaneous, hands of the fifteenth een·
EMEB· tury, denoad in this edition by the letters a, β, and γ.
The majority of these notes are written at the foot of
the pagos of the MS, and eonsist of additions to the
text of the Eulogium, collected from many different
sources, often contemporary with the events described,
and generally chosen with care and judgment. It
becomes a question of some interest to determine
whether these additions were in whole or in part
transcribed from the text of some original of the
Eulogium posterior to the autograph, or are, as they
at first sight appear to be, independent notes made to
the text of B. by three different readers of that MS.
My own opinion is that the latter supposition is the
more probahle one, and on the following grounds:
The additions are divisible into two classes: those
which oonsist of long passages of continuous nar·
rative, and those which are merely short entries
for different years in the Chronicle. The first, from
the great difficulty of fitting them into the text of
the Eulogium as it at present existe, so as to form
a new text of decent continuity which might have
probably belonged to a second and enlarged “edition ”
of the work, must, I think, be considered as indepen-
dent annotatione, taken direetly from the sources from
which they profess te bave been taken, and never at
any time forming an integral part of the text of the
Chronicle3 but the second, forming ne part of a con-
tinuous whole, might, at least on this ground, as well
’ have belonged to the text of such an edition, as to
a series of amplificatione independent of any original
MS. of the work It seems probable‚ however, that, ,
if they had been actually copied from a fuller MS.
of the Eulogium, some intimation, by way of marks
of reference, or in some other manner, would have
been given by the scribes that they belonged to the
text, in the same way that the original scribe of B.
