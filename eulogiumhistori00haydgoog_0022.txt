r *remoteness from the date of which hc was writing3
“¹¹⁵⁰“ while, if the fashion had. been discontinued‚ a past

tenso would have been certainly used. It follows there·
fore that he was writing at a date not later than A.D.
1362, and while the costume which he describes was
still in fashion. The evidence afforded by the auto-
graph, though not quite conclusive, is still confirmatory
01, 01 at tho least not inconsistent with, the supposition
that this curicus passage was actually written c'a Ab.
1362; for though the ink in which it is written ls
01 almost exactly the same oolour as that 01 the flve
ι suweding entries, a close comparison 01 the concluding

lines 01 the passage with the first lines of thc first
entry in sl). 1363 cereale cn appreciable difference
in the general appearance 01 the handwriting of these
two portione of the Ma, while tho forms of some of
the letters are decidedly discrepant The character at
the end 01 the first passage is crampcd and stiff, and
the letters arc longer than usual, while at the com·
mencement of the second the character is free, the
letters shorter and more widely separated. ln short,
there is just such n differenoe as might heve arisen
from the lapse of a short interval between the execu-
tion 01 the first passage and that 01 the second, though
it is certainly not a difference which would obtrude
itself on the eye of a careless render 01 tho MS. If
the cntry 101 AD. 1362 were written during that
year, it might have been set down es late as asch
March, A.D. 1363, according to the ordinary historical
computation3 while the two next entn'es, which appear
to have been written at once, and, 101 similar reasons
to those given above, before the following three, can-
not havc been written before the date of the later,
September, A.D. 1363. This interval 01 a few months
would satisfactorily account for the asserted difference

between thc characters 01 the two contiguous portione
01 the MS.
