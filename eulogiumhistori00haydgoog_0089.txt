ΤΗΕ authorities employed in the compilation of
the additions in 6100 complete Cotton MS. need only
be indicated, as the writers 01 them haue in general
given references to the works which they have used,
and the extracta have been almost always carefully
made. The chief sources 016100 notes printed in 6100
text 01 6100 present volume are the Historia Eccle-
siastico 01 Beda and the Gesta Regum Anglorum 06
William 01 Malmesbury.

The latter work alone has supplied the account 01
6100 kings of Essex in pp. 158, 9, of Wessex iu pp.
160, 1, and Nortbumbria in pp. 167, 8, while both
have contributed to those of the kings 01 East Anglia
in pp. 159,160, 01 Marcia in pp. 162-5, and of Kent
in pp. 367-9. The account 01 6100 first colonication

06 Albion in pp. 216-8 is found in the introduction of =

many 01 6100 Βο060 Chronicles. The addition inp. 242
is from Geoffrey· That in p. 257 apparently from
Martinus Polonus. That in pp. 265, 6 is professedly
taken from a Brute Ohronicle, as also are those in
pp. 302, 7, 66, and perhaps those in pp. 270, 80, 302,
and 319, 20. The majority 01 6100 additions in the
Third Volume have been taken from Petrus Pictaviensis,
01 whom some account will be given in the Proface, in
which the sources 01 6100 remaining portion 01 6100
Eulogium itself will bc considered.

In· explanation 01 the minutencss with which the
variatione between the text of our author and the
sources presumably employed by him have been given
in the notes to the forsgoing pagos, it may be stated
that the whole of the text of the Second and Third
Volumes had been 00006 to prees before the Editor
