in cap. xxxv. The account of Asia Minor is in the
words of Isidorus, and combines his account of Asia
Minor and that of its first province Bithynia, which
follows it in the Etymologiae. The account of Canaan
in cap. xxxvn. is entirely from the Geognrphia, the
reference to Isidorus, whose words are materially dif-
ferent, having heen doubtless copied from that work.
‘The long chapter on Amazonia and the Amazone is
also entirely from the Geographia with a few vcrhal
variatione. 'l'he account of Phrygia,⁸ in cap. xxxrx,
coincides very closely with the account in Isidorus,
which differs materially from the quotation from the
Etymologiae in the Geographia; this account, which
terminatas with the word “Iliuur,'' p. 37, l. 5, is
followed in tuost of the editions of Isidorus by two dis-
tinct chapters, oornmencing respectively “ Lycaoniam ”
und “Cariarn Hermus fluvius discernit a Phrygia ;'’ the
first of these is imperfect, consisting only of the first

word. Some very ancient MSS. of the Etymologiae
omit it altogether, while some unite the two chap-
ters, and read “Lycaoniam et Cariam Hermus fluvius
“discernit a Phrygin.'’ The descriptiones Lydia, in
cap. xn, occasionally varies both from 'that in the
Gcoggraphia, and from that in the Etymologiae; it is not
difficolt, however, to decide from which it was not taken,
