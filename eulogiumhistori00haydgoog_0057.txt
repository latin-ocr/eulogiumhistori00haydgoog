these suspicious facts, there is another curicus circum·
stancc to be noted, and that is that not only are the
authorities followed by Higdcn copied to the same
extent and in the same order as in the Polichronicon,
hut original remarks upon these authorities, though
apparently opposed to the opinions of our author, are
actually transcribed Thus, Higden in his chapter “ In
“ quibus rehem sufficit‚'' says, 01 course on his own
authority: “Et quamvis Beda dicit hanc terram vineis
“ noa expertem, et Solinus *et Isidorus ¹apibus eam
“ carere asserunt, circumspectius tamene diverso scrip-
“ sissent si eam vineis carere et apum expertem non
“ fuisse (esse. al) dixissent.” These words our author,
who only a few lines above has taken Higdcn 10 task
for underrating the assertione of Beda, Jerome, and
Isidorus, actually transcribes almost exaotly, only
accidentally omitting “fuisse” It is very probable,
however, that some of these inconsistencies may be
due to imperfect correction, 01 which the MS. A. here
shows evident signs. '

chapters of the Polichronicon are enumerated in the
