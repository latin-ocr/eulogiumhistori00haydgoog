had written these two passages after having heard of the
translation 61 Β61661, who was postulated 16 Ely bya
Papal Bull, dated l5th December, auratasne tern-
porolities being restored to him 21111 April, Ab. 1367,
it is extremely improbable that 116 would have pre·
ferred cluonicling the mere popular talk of 1116 likeli-
hood 61 desirableness of the translation 16 stating the
fact of 1116 translation 116611 ; it would be a very
minute Ohronicler indeed who, writing sometime after
the events, would include in the history 61 6 period
tha mere repert 61 1116 probability 61 66 episcopal pro-
6161166, which afterwards actually took place, for its
own sake only, and accordingly in no other 6111661616
61 the period which mentions the translation is the
report in question noticed. It is therefore all but
certain that these last entries were written before our
author had heard 61 the election 61 Β61661, 11161 16,
66 may fairly assume, before the middle of the year
1367, 611 1116 16661 disadvantageous computation. 'There
is only one fact which appears to wcigh against this
conclusion, and that is that just after the notice 61
the 61661166 61 Wykeham an account of his consecration
is promised in a future page (“quou10do 66666616166
“imposterum plenius explicetur”), as if the author had
been aware that it had already taken place. Now as
this consecration was not celebrated until lOth October,
Ab. 1307, it seems morally certain that 11 116 had heard
61 11 he 611161 6166 have heard 61 1116 electior of Barnet.
It is far 16616 likely that when the account 61 the
consecration was promised, 661· author, with many
others, expected that it would follow the electiou very
closely, according to custom, and made no allowence
1611116 unusual delay iu this instance 61 1116 Papal
confirmation.
