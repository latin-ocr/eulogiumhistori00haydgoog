On the aoth of Januury 1857, the Mester of the Rolls
submitted to the Treasury a proposal for the publication
of materiale for the History of this Oountry from the
Invasion of the Romans to the Reign of Henry VIII.

The Master of the Rolls suggested that these materiale
should be selected for publication under competent editors
without reference to periodical or chronological arrange·
ment, without mutilation or abridgment, preference being
given, in the first instance, to such materiale as were most
scarae and valuoble.

He proposed that each chronicle or historical document Δ
to be cdited should he treated in the same way as if the
editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps; and for this .
purpose the mostocorrect text should be formed from an
accurate collation of the best MSS.

To render the work more generally useftd, the Master
of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS. employed by him, of their age and
their peculiarities ς that he should add to the work a brief

account of the life and times of the author, and any
remarks necessary to explain the chronology3 but no other
note or comment was to be allowed, except what might be
necessary to establish the correctness of the text.
