Gaetulia, is altogether from the Geographia¹ The ao·
count of Byzacena is entirely from Isidorus. The
account of Zeugia (or Zeugitana, or Zeugis) is also
from isidorus, who is copied so faithfully that his short
note on (tetum, which follows the description of
Zeugis, is set down as part of it, notwithstanding
the existence of the description of Gaetulia already
given in cap. xnvn. The last sentence of the chapter
is from the account of Zeugis in the Geographia
and the words “et elephantis et pardis ” from some
unknown source. The account of Numidia commences
in the words of the Geographia, which end with the
first line; that which follows, is from Isidorus with a
few unimportant omissions and uariatione.⁹ The account
of Mauritania³ commences with a quotation from Isi-
dorus also in the Gcographia3 butas the latter is not
so faithfully copied from the Etymologiae as our text, it
is not difficult to decide which of the two our author
has used. As soon as the extract from Isidorus termi-
natas, the Geographia‚ however, is certainly taken up,
the remainder of the chapter being a copy of the
paraphrasc in that work of Pliny's account of Mauri-
tania in his Hist Nat. lib. v. The mistakes in the
Geographia are here faithfully reproduoed.⁴ The ac·
