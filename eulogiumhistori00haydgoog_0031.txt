the Eulogium to two authorities only, S. Augustino,

De Civitate Dei, lib. 16, cap. 8, and Pliny, Historia
Naturalis, lib. 6, while in the Polichronicon the corre-
sponding passages are co'rrectly referred in addition
to Isidorus, Etymol. lib. ls and lib. 5, and to
Pliny, Hist. Nat lib. 3, cap. 1. The reference to
Pliny in the Eulogium appears to have been copied
without verification, lor it properly belongs to an
extract from that author in the Pohchronicon‚ which
is not transcribed in the Eulogium: “Asia quantitate
“ maxima Europe minor, sed par in populorum gene-
“ rositate numerosa'' The second chapter displays
similar inaccuracies3 a reference to the Topographia of
(liraldus Gambrensis is omitted, in consequence of which
“ a passage giving the name “brachium Sancti Georgii ’'
to the Straits os Constantinople, appears to be assigned
to Pliny, who also seems to be responsible for a
quotation from Isidorus, Etym. lib. 9, which is not
quoted irom Pliny. In the third chapter, the refer-
ences to Isidorus, lib. 13, and to Pliny, lib. 2, cap. 99,
which arc correctly assigned in the Polichrorricon to the
first paragraph of the chapter, are entirely omitted,
while the second sentence oi the paragraph itselfis
unconstruable, from the omission of the latter of two
alternatives with which it concludes.l A reference to
Paulus (Marcus Paulus Venetus, ita, Marco Polo), lib. l,
of the second paragraph of this chapter, is also omitted.
The Eulogium now leaves the Pohchronicon‚ aud takes
up the Etymologiae, and the fourth chapter is almost
verbally transcribed from lib. 13, cap. 17, of that
worlr. In capv. cap. 18 of the same Bo'ok is followed,
