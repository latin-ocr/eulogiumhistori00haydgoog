Manu- “Italia Jam intendimus” (preceded by the rmt 'tial D.
{3¹0¹ paim, of the first tsentence of tho Fifth Book, and a portion

'Booko only of the word immediately before this) to the lastt on try
in AB. 1346, where it terminatas 1n the middle of a
page. Itis written on vellum in single columne, and
the character of the handwriting and style of floriation
of the capitale show it to belong to the early part
of the fifteenth century. The text agrees very closely
with that of the autograph Α ahcady described in the
Proface to the First Volume, so closely, indeed, that
only a few peges of its various readings have been
published. It is foliated in more modern hands than
that of its text, at the foot of the first nine leaves,
the first number being 34, and at the top, from 1. 2 to

108, and a note at 1 58, in an old hand: “li⁰. 5.

“ ca 50,’' shows it either to have actually formed, or
to have been recognized as having once formed, the Fifth

Book of some larger work when this note was written.

I have not succeeded in discovering the remainder of

this MS, but this is the less to be regretted as the

MS. itself has no independent velue, differing only from

A. to the disadvant tage of its own text.

what MS. the transcript was made. Though the text

coincides very closely with that of A, O, and Ε. (ge-
