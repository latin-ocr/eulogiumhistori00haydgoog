In cap. cumn. the coincidence oi our text with
that of the Polichronicon is very close indeed, until
we come to the description of the course of the four
Great Roads or Ways in Britain, when very important
differences between the two werke become apparent.
Still the coincidences are so numerous as to have sug-
gested to Gale inan Essay on the Four Roman Ways
(Leland‚ Itinerary, ed. Hearne, Oxon. 1749, vol. vi. p. 108)
the supposition that Higden and our author copied the
“ same draught.” A fuller collation, however, of the
numerous manmcripts of the Polichronicon would be
necessary before the question could be satisfactorily
decided. The text of the Eulogium approximates far

more closely to that of the MS. Harl No. 655 than
to the text of the Polichronicon as represented in the
Quindecim Scriptores, as the results of a collation of
the two in the foot note will shew.¹ The latter repre-
sents the majority of the MSS. of the Polichronicon..
