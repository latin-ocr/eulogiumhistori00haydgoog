and the censetor of E. have given notice tc their Adriacas
readers of the proper positiones passages omitted from ‘⁰³⁵5' B.
the text of those MSS. Such marks occur, however,
only in a very few instances, and their presence may
be well explained inthose instancesby othersuppositions,
so that the balance of probability remeius slightly

no danger of confounding them with the text of any
one of the existing manuscripts, while they are at
'the same time easily accessihle.
With regard to the relative dates of the three-sets
of annotatione there are very few facts from which
any conclusion can be drawn. It appears that a
note in the hand (a) hae been written below a noto
iu the hand (γ), (p. 263, note⁸), that a note in the

hand (β) hae been continued below a note in the same
