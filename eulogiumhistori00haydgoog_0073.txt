PREFAOE. lxv

In cap. 1111111111. there is first an account, condensed
from 11111 part of 1111 Poliohronicon which has been
drawn upon for the materiale of the accounts of Ire-
lend, Scohland, ¹ und England, of the various rocos
existing in Britain from the Britone to 1111Νο111111.ι
This is followed by e brief history, apparently from
the Sixth Book of Higden’s work,l of tho origin of
the Normen Invasion. It was probably taken by him
from the Fimt Book ofthe Historia N ovoruin of Eadmer ;

but our author has evidently not gone to the original
source. At the end of the chapter another account
