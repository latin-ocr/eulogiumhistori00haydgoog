sequently to the last. The next, belonging to the
historical year 11111365, seems to have been written
subsequently. Tho next two entries, both belonging to
the historical year An. 1361, were written at the
same time and subsequently to tha 1111 Alterwards

belonging to the historical year 11111365, appears to

clearly show, the marriage 61 the princess Isahel. At
a subsequent period, perhaps, the missien ο1 Edmund
Langley and others to Flanders was set down. About
the same time nearly the account 61 the battle near
Adrianople3 after which the earthqualre 11 Rhodes,
which partly precedes and partly follows it, was in·

some subsequcnt time it is clear that the death and
11116111 61 William de Edingdon were entered, possibly
when the erased paragraph which follows was written
down. The two next entries appear to have been
written simultaneonsly, but at a different time 16 the
two which follow them. The two last were perhaps
written down together.
